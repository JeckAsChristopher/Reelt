Reelt v0.2 - Pre-release

What is Reelt?

Reelt (Reverse Engineering ELF Linux Tool) is a reverse engineering tool built for analyzing ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) binaries on Linux systems.

It translates raw or binary machine code into a more human-readable format.

> Currently, Reelt supports only ELF executables â€” other binary formats are not supported in this version.



> Note: Reelt uses external libraries totaling around 400 MB, so make sure you have enough disk space during setup.
